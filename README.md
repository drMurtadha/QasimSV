How deep or focus this problem statement is "As traditional security measures can no longer provide the essential protection from the rapidly growing targeted and highly sophisticated attacks
targeting air-gapped critical networks. How can Machine Learning algorithms
be utilized in air-gapped critical infrastructure networks to detect cyber-attacks
without compromising the nature of these isolated networks? The proposed
solution should factor the sensitivity of these networks and not infringe on
their isolation and adapt to the most dangerous attack vectors: Insider threats
and supply chain attacks."
